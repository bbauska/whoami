One of the most critical things parents, friends or classmates of someone diagnosed with autism 
spectrum disorder can do is educate yourself about it while recognizing their strengths.

You can develop increased compassion for your loved ones, classmates, friends and colleagues by 
recognizing and understanding more about the condition. While you can't eliminate a child's autism 
or wait for them to outgrow it, you can minimize some of its symptoms and improve quality of life.
