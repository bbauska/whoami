<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>I am Brian Bauska. Systems Analyst/Database Admin, retired. Working on UAP Disclosure in 
its' many flavors. And, with democracy on my side, this will be accomplished in 20 years or 
my death. Whichever comes first.</p>

<p>Based in Washington-state, I aim to raise awareness about Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena 
(UAP), fostering interest, and promote global collaboration. My goal is to improve outreach 
efforts, reduce stigma, and provide reliable information about UAP.</p>

<p>My mission focuses on three main audiences:</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
  <li>The general public, with the aim of outreaching, reducing prejudice and providing accessible cultural 
  spaces for the public to access information about UAP, with a specific emphasis on engaging young people.</li>
  <li>I aim to raise awareness among political actors about the public interest in UAP and the 
   national security implications associated with it. I will strive to bring the discussion 
   to the international, highlighting subjects like the assessment of peace and security 
   implications of UAP incidents, as well as the evaluation and anticipation of societal 
   impacts in the event of possible discoveries related to intelligent signals or exogenous 
   elements.</li>
  <li>Supporting Science at heart. And those scientists who aren't cowards and still have a desire 
   for data. My mission involves the education of the science community. 
   I'm hoping to gain assistance from France and more particular Dr. Jacque Valle. With more than 20 
years of experience, considering the work done at GEIPAN France, I aim to demonstrate the 
availability of tools to study and analyze unknown phenomena, and the importance of entrusting 
this enigma to scientists. I seek to encourage official institutions to integrate research and 
study programs on UAP, to share common practices through methodological approach, create an 
international process to tackle and share efficiently. Unknown Phenomena to break the walls of subjectivity.</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to foster the creation of a new field of Science, the “Science of the Unknown”.</p>

<p>I wish to centralize knowledge, break barriers by supporting the emergence and establishment 
of international and transdisciplinary research networks among countries worldwide.</p>

<p>I am here for the humanity as a whole and for the people who wants to make things change.</p>

<p>My Project revolves around six units that align with my mission and vision. These units are 
divided into two divisions: the first one is focused on and connecting actors and strategic 
analysis to adjust our action to the continuously evolving landscape, and the other on communication, outreaching and pedagogy.</p>

<h3>Strategic Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Organizations</b>: I maintain an observatory of organizations with partnerships and advisors, 
providing activity reports on UP networks worldwide and their ongoing projects.</p></li>
  <li>
<p><b>Coordination</b>: this involves organizing UAP-related discussions across various domains, such as associations, policies, science, technologies and culture.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Policies</b>: I aim to publish analytical reports on UAP-related laws, reflections, political bodies 
and their current projects.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>News & Media</b>: I have a dedicated team of one (me) as a journalist who provide 
reliable information about UAP.</p>
<p>I am using fact-check media sources and create article translations in multiple languages, 
starting with English and French. This activity is supported by an AI software that automatically 
aggregates information and provides worldwide news coverage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>My News Channel @UAPBauska</li>
  <li>My Partner Channel @BauskaUAP</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><b>Technology & Science</b>: this unit focuses on pedagogical information. Through this 
team a significant focus of my project is on the distribution of an automated investigation 
software for UAP. I also aim to create a common framework for sharing tools, documentation, 
knowledge bases, database structures, and educational brochures. Additionally, we will publish 
dossiers and establish an observatory to track progress in science.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Culture & Society</b: here, I conduct a census of cultural activities related to UAP, 
including programs, films, books etc. And a comprehensive tour of the world of ongoing events. 
I will offer resources and will be involved in the realization of exhibition onto the UAP Subject 
with the aim to produce permanent centers for the public to get information.</p></li>
